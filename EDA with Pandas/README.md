Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The notebook demonstrates best practices for understanding and preparing data before conducting further analysis or modeling.

Features

1. Data Loading

Imports the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values: Identifies and manages missing entries.

Text Standardization: Ensures uniform formatting of textual data.

Data Type Correction: Resolves issues with incorrect data types.

3. Descriptive Statistics

Computes and displays:

Summary statistics for numerical data (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).

Frequency counts for categorical data.

4. Data Visualization

Generates visual representations of the data to uncover trends and patterns:

Histograms

Scatter plots

Box plots

Bar charts

5. Key Insights

Summarizes findings from the EDA process to guide future steps, such as feature engineering or predictive modeling.

Requirements

The following Python libraries are used:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

numpy

Ensure these packages are installed before running the notebook.

Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the EDA.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.
